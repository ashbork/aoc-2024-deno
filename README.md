# Ashley's AoC 2024

Written in Deno using TS with a mostly functional style. Note that the input will be different for you -- replace my `input.txt`'s contents with yours to get the correct answers. Puzzles sourced from <https://adventofcode.com/> by Eric Wastl.

## My goals for this year

In previous years, I've been bouncing off of AoC; I'd like to try to complete it this year

- [ ] Do at least half of the puzzles on 1*
- [ ] Do all puzzles on 1*
- [ ] Do at least half of the puzzles on 2*
- [ ] Do all puzzles on 2*

## Journal

Day 2: That 2* was awful, I had to look for some hints -- worst part is I felt like I was close to getting a much better solution. Makes me scared for the future.

## Usage

### Running specific day

```shell
deno --allow-read .\day<x>\solution.ts
